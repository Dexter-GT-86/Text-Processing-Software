Introduction

This assessment involves working with textual data. The aim is to extract relevant information, process it, and transform it into a useful format. The project is structured into various sections, each focusing on different aspects of data processing.

Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

You can run the notebook (task2_group68.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. To execute the Python script, use the following command:

python task2_group68.py

Notebook

The notebook includes detailed explanations and code cells that demonstrate the steps involved in textual data processing. It is divided into the following sections:

	•	Introduction
	•	Importing Libraries
	•	Data Extraction
	•	Data Processing
	•	Data Transformation
	•	Analysis and Results

Python Script

The script contains the implementation of the data processing pipeline. It is designed to be run independently and performs the same operations as described in the notebook.

Features

	•	Data Extraction: Extracts data from various sources.
	•	Data Processing: Cleans and processes the extracted data.
	•	Data Transformation: Transforms the data into a desired format for analysis.
	•	Analysis: Provides insights and results based on the processed data.
